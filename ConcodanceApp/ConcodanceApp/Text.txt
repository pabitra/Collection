An architecture framework is a tool which can be used for developing a broad range of
different architectures [architecture descriptions]. It should describe a method for
designing an information system in terms of a set of building blocks, and for showing how
the building blocks fit together. It should contain a set of tools and provide a common
vocabulary. It should also include a list of recommended etc. standards and compliant  i.e.
products that can be used to implement the building blocks.
